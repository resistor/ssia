# SSIA - Superscalar Stack Issue Array

This is an implementation of a superscalar stack issue array, based on the design in ["Investigation of a Superscalar Operand Stack Using FO4 and ASIC Wire-Delay Metrics"](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/vlsi/2014/493189/).

The implementation is done in [Amaranth HDL](https://amaranth-lang.org).
